        A chocolate brownie, or simply a brownie, is a chocolate baked confection.
         Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, 
         depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, 
         have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, 
         frosting, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. 
         A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in 
         the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. 
         The brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and 
         popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.
